- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F7), which is desaturated blue, providing a clean, modern backdrop.
- Accent color: Subtle green (#81C784), an analogous color to the primary blue, used for positive confirmations and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that is modern but still retains some warmth, will ensure readability in both Arabic and English.
